Welcome to The Katastrophes team submission to the Road Warrors Kata run by O'Reilly during [September 2023](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/architectural-katas/0636920097101/0636920097100/).

## The Team

We are the one-of-a-kind ensemble known as Team Kata-strophes. We're like a puzzle where all the pieces are slightly bent, but miraculously, it still forms a beautiful picture.

We're the living embodiment of organized chaos – our meetings might seem like a rollercoaster ride through a maze of tangents, but we always manage to reach our destination.  You’ll see that being a little dysfunctional can be incredibly functional – and a whole lot of fun!
