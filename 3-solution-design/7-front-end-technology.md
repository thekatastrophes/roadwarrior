The web application and the mobile application will be developed using a front-end framework that enables developing hybrid mobile applications, as explained in ADR003.

The user interface will be compliant with the latest W3C standards. It will be based on responsive design, that serves the content to multiple devices from the same codebase, making it easily maintainable. The application will be identical on the latest version of the most used browsers and mobile phones.
