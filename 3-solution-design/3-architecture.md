# Architecture Design

The architectural design is based on the Event Driven Serverless Microservices. The following diagram illustrates the components / microservices and the communication between them.

Event-Driven Microservices architecture leverages the strengths of both microservices and event-driven design, blending modularity and flexibility with real-time responsiveness and efficiency. Its foundation rests on three key principles: loose coupling, message-driven communication, and asynchronous processing. These principles synergize to construct a scalable, resilient, and high-performance distributed system.
